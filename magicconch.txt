Get back to work. Mr. Krabs demands it.
Go to bed.
Hail the Magic Conch.
Do your homework.
Check your Facebook.
Go play some video games.
Go get something to eat. Maybe some Krabby Patties?
Quench your thirst.
Keep using the Magic Conch.
Exit the Kelp Forest.
Go jellyfishing.
Go hang out with some friends. Maybe go see your pal Squidward?
Save the world from devastation.
