A Chat Bot For Skype

This is a Chat Bot for Skype with various manual commands or automatic features from raadio to slapping other users to pulling up the title of Youtube links as they're posted.

This a modified version of the Java4Skype API because the actual thing is garbage. Also the Skype API itself it garbage.

Due to this overload of garbage, the bot will not work correctly in chats that aren't MULTI_SUBSCRIBED -- that is, don't have more than 2 people in them.

You can add the bot itself but I am not longer running it. His username is teslarobot, but he is no longer in use.
