A Chat Bot For Skype

This is a Chat Bot for Skype with various manual commands or automatic features from raadio to slapping other users to pulling up the title of Youtube links as they're posted.

This a modified version of the Java4Skype API because the actual thing is garbage. Also the Skype API itself it garbage.

Due to this overload of garbage, the bot will not work correctly in chats that aren't MULTI_SUBSCRIBED -- that is, don't have more than 2 people in them.
	The radio feature will also stop working if a single person in a group chat does not pickup the call.

You can add the bot itself to test it out. His username is teslarobot, but he is only online when I am online (no dedicated computer).
