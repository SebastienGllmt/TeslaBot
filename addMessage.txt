Hello, <user>.

 My name is Nikola Tesla, your friendly Skype Bot.

 Your friend, <friend>, has requested that I add you as a friend.

 This will allow him to send me commands using your display name and also allows you to send commands to me as you wish.

 Unfortunately, I do not work very well in one on one conversations, so commands might not be recognized.

 Type in !help to get a list of available commands.
